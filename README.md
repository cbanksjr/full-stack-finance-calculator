# Full Stack Finance Calculator
## This project is currently a WIP

This is a full stack iteration of a console version of the finance calculator written in Java and a frontend version written in ReactJS.
This version uses ReactJS, Spring Boot, and H2 Database. Users can save their allocations to a specific category and see the total allocated to those categories.
