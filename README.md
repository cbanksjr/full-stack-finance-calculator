# Full Stack Finance Calculator
This is a full stack iteration of a console version of the finance calculator written in Java and a frontend version written in ReactJS.
This version uses ReactJS, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL Database. Users can save their allocations to a specific category and see the total allocated to those categories. 

## Project Idea
I created the initial projects to help myself allocate finances for my wife's business without having to do the math on my phone or in my head. After a few uses, I figured it would be better to keep track of where those allocations were going through a database and returned to the client side instead of having to write them down.
